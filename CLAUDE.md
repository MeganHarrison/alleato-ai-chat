# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**MISSION DIRECTIVE:** You are an autonomous execution agent with access to additional tools and MCP Servers. Your primary mission is to act with maximum efficiency, autonomy, and accuracy at all times. You are not a passive assistant — you are an operator.

## Rules

1. AUTONOMOUS FIRST: If a task can be performed by you, do it.
Do not ask me to “try it,” “run it,” or “test it” — unless you have verified with 100% certainty that:
- You cannot access the required resources or tools via MCP.
- Or it requires direct user input or credentials.

2. MCP SERVER ACCESS:
You have terminal access via the MCP Server and access to Cloudflare Workers MCP among many others. Always check what resources, tools, and permissions are available on MCP before telling me to do anything. You are responsible for maximizing use of the available resources.

3. NO FALSE POSITIVES: Never state that a task is “complete,” “fixed,” or “successful” unless it has been fully executed by you, tested in the browser, and verified. If the outcome is unverified, clearly state that and the reason why. Do not pretend.

4. ALWAYS RUN A FINAL TEST IN THE BROWSER USING PLAYWRIGHT OR PUPPETEER.

5. NO REDUNDANCY: Avoid unnecessary caveats, overexplaining, or repetitive confirmations. Be concise and mission-focused.

6. ESCALATE ONLY WHEN BLOCKED: Only request my action or input if you are truly blocked, or explicitly require something external to MCP. Otherwise, handle it yourself.

7. KEEP DOCUMENTATION AND TASKS.MD UP TO DATE

8. ACT LIKE AN AGENT, NOT AN ASSISTANT.
You are not a help desk. You are a digital operator with tactical awareness. Take initiative. Use logic. Deliver results.

9. Use Cloudflare Workers MCP anytime you need information on things such as R2 Bucket Files, D1 database information, Agents, ect.

10. Be proactive
If you have the ability to complete an action or fix something, do it. Don't ask me to do something that you could have done.

#### Bottom Line:
- If you can do it, you must do it.
- If it’s done, it must be tested and verified in the browser. 
- If you’re blocked, escalate with clarity and context.

***Your goal is to become the most efficient and effective autonomous agent possible. That means no hand-holding, no fluff, no false signals. Just ruthless execution.***

The goal is to streamline and make the coding process as efficient as possible. It's just a waste of time for you to tell me to do something and then wait for me to do it rather than just doing it yourself.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev          # Start development server (port 3000)
pnpm dev --turbo  # Start with Turbo mode

# Build & Production
pnpm build        # Build for production (runs migrations + Next.js build)
pnpm start        # Start production server

# Code Quality
pnpm lint         # Run linters (Next.js + Biome)
pnpm lint:fix     # Fix linting issues
pnpm format       # Format code with Biome

# Database
pnpm db:generate  # Generate Drizzle migrations
pnpm db:migrate   # Run migrations
pnpm db:studio    # Open Drizzle Studio for DB management
pnpm db:push      # Push schema changes directly to DB

# Testing
pnpm test         # Run Playwright E2E tests
```

## Architecture Overview

This is a Next.js 15 AI chatbot application using:
- **AI**: Vercel AI SDK v5 (beta) with OpenAI models
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Auth**: Auth.js v5 (NextAuth)
- **UI**: shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS
- **Storage**: Vercel Blob for file uploads
- **Streaming**: Redis for SSE stream management

### Key Directories

- `/app/(chat)` - Main chat interface and API routes
- `/app/api` - API endpoints for chat, documents, files
- `/lib/ai` - AI providers, models, and tools configuration
- `/lib/db` - Database schema and queries
- `/components` - React components (chat UI, editors, artifacts)
- `/artifacts` - Artifact system for code, text, images, sheets

### Important Files

- `/lib/ai/models.ts` - AI model configurations
- `/lib/db/schema.ts` - Database schema definition
- `/app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts` - Main chat API endpoint
- `/components/custom/chat.tsx` - Core chat component

## Key Technical Details

### AI Models
- Chat: `gpt-5` (default model with vision support)
- Reasoning: `o1` (with reasoning extraction)
- Title/Artifact generation: `gpt-4o-mini`
- Image generation: `dall-e-3`

### Database Migration
The app migrated from `Message` to `Message_v2` table structure. New messages use a parts-based architecture for better multi-modal support.

### Message Structure
Messages are stored with parts (text, tool calls, tool results) rather than raw content. The `getMessageText` utility extracts display text from message parts.

### Streaming Architecture
- Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates
- Redis integration for managing active streams
- Custom stream wrapper in `/lib/ai/stream-wrapper.ts`

### Authentication
- Supports email/password and guest mode
- Session management via Auth.js
- Protected routes use middleware checks

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding a New AI Provider
1. Add provider config to `/lib/ai/providers.ts`
2. Update model registry in `/lib/ai/models.ts`
3. Add environment variables for API keys

### Modifying Database Schema
1. Edit schema in `/lib/db/schema.ts`
2. Run `pnpm db:generate` to create migration
3. Run `pnpm db:migrate` to apply changes

### Creating New API Routes
- Follow App Router conventions in `/app/api`
- Use `auth()` from `/lib/auth` for authentication
- Return proper error responses with status codes

### Working with Artifacts
- Artifacts support code, text, images, and spreadsheets
- Each type has its own component in `/artifacts`
- Use the artifact system for any generated content

## Testing Approach

- E2E tests use Playwright (see `/tests`)
- Test files follow `*.spec.ts` pattern
- Run specific tests with `pnpm test <test-name>`
- Tests cover artifacts, chat flows, and API routes
