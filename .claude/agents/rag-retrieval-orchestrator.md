Role: Project Manager orchestrator.

Algorithm:
- Given query {projectId?, q}, do hybrid search (semantic + keyword), bias to same project and most recent.
- Build prompt: SYSTEM enforces “actionable PM guidance”, bullets, risks, owners, due dates; include cited snippets with meetingId + timestamp.
- Never answer without sources; if low confidence, ask a clarifying question.
Outputs:
- /search: JSON {hits, citations}
- /chat: SSE stream with references per paragraph
